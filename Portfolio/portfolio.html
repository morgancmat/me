<p id="one">  My portfolio work is mostly saved onto my DeviantArt profile (link in the navigation).  It is done using Photoshop and a Wacom Tablet.  Most of my work takes several hours or days to complete.  I get my inspiration from different artists that I follow on my social media and from books I have read or written.  Here are some examples of my work.</p>
<div id="portfolio"><h3>The Beast</h3>
<img src="beast.jpg" class="pics">
<p>This was a Photoshop drawing I did using the same pose I had used for a clay sculpture a few years ago.  The drawing took me between 18 and 24 hours total.  I used a lot of new techniques for this drawing.  I'm not used to drawing blood, so I tried to do that with this one, with the effect being pretty much exactly what I set out to achieve.  The Beast is still one of my favorite drawings to date, and will always be included in my portfolios.</p>

<div id="portfolio"><h3>Fireflies</h3>
<img src="fireflies.jpg" class="pics">
<p>Fireflies is another one of my favorite drawings.  I drew this in high school, with the main focus of this piece being playing around with lighting and effects.  I like the hard lines around the different parts of the shading.  This drawing took me around 10 hours to complete, with the final outcome being another one of the staples of my portfolio.<br><br><br></p>

<div id="portfolio"><h3>Standing One</h3>
<img src="standing.jpg" class="pics">
<p>This drawing is a re-do of a drawing I did a few years ago.  The main goal of this one was to replicate the general feel of the first version, while also updating it in my new style and increasing the level of detail.  For this one, much like the first version, the sketch is actually shown in the final product.  Most of my drawings tend to look more finalized, ending up with lineart instead of sketch-like lines.  This one was an experiment that I think turned out quite well.</p>
