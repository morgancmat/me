<li>Find a design mentor who will support your exploration and give critical feedback.

<li>Test the app experience with participants to ensure that the experience you expect is the experience had by audiences.

<li>Target your audience to ask for specific needs they have.

<li>When your app is complete and tested properly, deploy it in accessible marketplaces.

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p class="questions">When should I ask my target audience for their preferred features?</p>

<p>Ask multiple times in the process, starting with the beginning of the project. Your audience might have different needs or restrictions that you have not thought of.</p>

<p class="questions"> Can I create a few wireframes and have someone turn it into an app for me?</p>

<p>No. You will need to conceive of the usable design, the backend coding and account for the whole user experience yourself or as a team.</p>

<p class="questions">Can I spend a couple of minutes with a customer and have it count as design critique?</p>

<p>No, you need to fully understand the user's context for using the app to ensure it is most effective. Plan to spend at least an hour with them using the app.</p>

<p class="questions">What do I do when I have released a beta version of my app?</p>

<p>Be ready to address system bugs as they occur from your users.</p>
